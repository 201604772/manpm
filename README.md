## Badge

If you module has API well-described in the README, and `manpm <text>` works well,
consider adding the following `manpm compatible` badge to your README. Here is the markdown

```
[![manpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/manpm-compatible-3399ff.svg)](https://github.com/bahmutov/manpm)
```

## Install

    npm install -g manpm

## Show entire readme

    manpm <package name>

For example `manpm email-regex` will render the README from
[email-regex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-regex) package in you terminal

## Show part of the readme

    manpm <package name> [optional search text inside README]

If search text is provided, only a section of the README file with that text
(if found) will be displayed.

## Inspired by the following tools

* [man-n](https://github.com/man-n/man-n)
* [npm-man](https://github.com/eush77/npm-man)
* [readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readme)

I wanted something a little more API friendly, like finding and showing
a README section that talked about a specific API method for example.
